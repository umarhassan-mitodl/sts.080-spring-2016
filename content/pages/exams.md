There was one test given during STS.080. In keeping with the theme of the course, the essay questions were written collaboratively by the students and the instructor. Below are sample test questions.

1.  How has youth participation varied by race and student status?
2.  How has the concept of childhood changed / stayed the same?
3.  What issues have American youth cared about? Which concerns have changed over time and which have stayed the same?
4.  What different kinds of participatory approaches have youth used? Can you assess their comparative efficacy?

  
_In lieu of a second test at the end of the semester, students collaborated with the instructor to create an alternative second assignment. Students worked on presentations that applied the ideas learned in their historical study to design a campaign for an issue they cared about._
